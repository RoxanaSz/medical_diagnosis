  "hypothesis": "Benign or non-life-threatening causes of chest pain, such as musculoskeletal pain (e.g., costochondritis, muscle strain), gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., GERD, esophageal spasm), or anxiety/panic disorder, are the likely etiology after initial stabilization and preliminary exclusion of immediately life-threatening cardiac and acute pleuropulmonary pathologies.",

    "Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)",

  "actions_recommended": [
    "Conduct a thorough focused history to elicit characteristics suggestive of benign causes: reproducible pain with palpation or movement (musculoskeletal), relation to food or swallowing (GI), heartburn or regurgitation (GERD), recent stressors or panic attack history (anxiety).",
    "Perform a detailed physical examination including meticulous chest wall palpation for focal tenderness (costochondritis, muscle strain, rib fracture), assessment of dermatomal pain patterns (herpes zoster, radiculopathy), abdominal examination for epigastric or right upper quadrant tenderness, and careful auscultation for cardiac or pulmonary abnormalities.",
    "Review all initial diagnostic results (ECG, serial troponins, Chest X-ray, D-dimer if obtained) to confirm the low likelihood of acute cardiac or emergent pleuropulmonary pathology.",
    "Consider a trial of therapeutic interventions specific to benign causes: antacids or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for suspected GERD, NSAIDs or acetaminophen for musculoskeletal pain (if no contraindications).",
    "If anxiety/panic disorder is strongly suspected after excluding organic causes, provide reassurance and consider short-acting anxiolytics if indicated and appropriate.",
    "If gastrointestinal causes persist as a leading differential, consider focused laboratory tests (e.g., amylase, lipase, liver function tests) and potential referral for outpatient gastroenterology evaluation (e.g., endoscopy) if symptoms are recurrent or refractory.",
    "Educate the patient on the benign nature of their symptoms once serious conditions are adequately ruled out, provide discharge instructions, and advise on follow-up with primary care for ongoing management of specific conditions (e.g., chronic GERD, musculoskeletal pain).",
    "Maintain vigilance and continue to monitor for any changes in vital signs or clinical status that might suggest an evolving or previously unappreciated serious condition, until the patient is stable and discharged or transferred."
